```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load Initial Data

asdasdasd

```{r data-log}
df_lines_raw = read_csv("data/simpsons_script_lines.csv")
df_episodes_raw = read_csv("data/simpsons_episodes.csv")
```

## EDA

```{r eda}
head(df_lines_raw)
```

Removing some extraneous columns to make things easier to work with:

```{r filtering}
df_lines <-
  df_lines_raw %>%
  # Drop line number and episode timestamp (for now)
  select(!matches("number", "timestamp_in_ms")) %>% 
  # drop NA rows - these are non-character dialogs or descriptive text
  drop_na()

df_lines
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
